// TODO make a class that is an interface that you can use to interact with models in the front end
// Example: the User modal manager can have User.getFirstName(),
// The backend normally returns a first and last name for a User object, but this interface allows for 
// abstraction of the modals in the frontend

// This class needs to take in the type that an API returns. 
// From there, you use this base class to define 

class baseModelManager() {
